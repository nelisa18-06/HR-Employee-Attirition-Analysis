HR Employee Attrition Analysis
Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical problem for organizations as it directly impacts productivity, cost, and workforce stability.
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns using the IBM HR Analytics dataset to understand the key factors that influence employees leaving the company.

The project is implemented as an end-to-end data analytics project using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

 # Objectives of the Project

The main goals of this project are:

To clean and prepare raw HR data for analysis

To analyze factors affecting employee attrition

To identify trends based on department, job role, overtime, income, and experience

To visualize insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard

 # Dataset

Dataset Name: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

Source: Kaggle

# Description:
The dataset contains employee information such as age, department, job role, income, overtime, work experience, job satisfaction, and attrition status.

 # Tools & Technologies Used
 Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – basic data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – analysis and documentation

 SQL (SQLite)

Used to store cleaned data

Performed aggregation and grouping queries for analysis

 Power BI

Built interactive dashboards

Visualized attrition patterns by different factors

 # Data Cleaning Steps

The following data cleaning steps were performed in Python:

Checked and handled missing values

Verified duplicate records

Validated data ranges (Age, Monthly Income, Experience, etc.)

Ensured correct data types for numerical and categorical columns

 # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand:

Overall attrition distribution

Attrition by department

Attrition by job role

# Impact of overtime on attrition

Relationship between income, experience, and attrition

Power BI Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Department-wise attrition comparison

Job Role vs Attrition analysis

Overtime impact on employee attrition

Income and experience-based attrition trends

These visualizations help in quickly identifying high-risk employee groups.

# Key Insights

Employees working overtime show higher attrition rates

Certain job roles experience significantly higher attrition

Lower income and lesser experience levels are associated with higher attrition

Attrition patterns vary across departments
